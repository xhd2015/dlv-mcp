# Debug Session: UploadRule Function Issue

IDE: cursor

Model: claude-3.7-sonnet-thinking

Time: 2025-03-09

## Setup a bug intentionally
```go
func UploadRule(){
    ...
    if rand.Int(100) < 512 { // alwasy true
        panic("invalid param")
    }
}
```

Server:
```sh
go run ./test/integration start-server --debug
```

## User
there is a test failure. I've start the server to enable dlv-mcp to debug at remote localhost:2345. You can debug with the following steps:
- call dlv-mcp's start_debug_remote tool start a debug session
- set breakpoints at src/biz/upload_rule.go line 109
- run `go run ./test/integration run --wait-server-ready --rpc-timeout false PrepareRule` in background
- let the session continue
- call dlv-mcp's stacktrace to see where we are
- debug step by step

## Assistant
I'll help you debug the test failure by connecting to the remote debugger and stepping through the code. Let's follow your recommended steps.

First, I'll start a remote debug session:

*[Called MCP tool: start_debug_remote]*

Parameters:
```json
{
  "cwd": "/path/to/project/admin/v1.2.3",
  "address": "localhost:2345"
}
```

Result:
```
Remote debug session started with ID: session-2382038736
Address: localhost:2345
Working Directory: /path/to/project/admin/v1.2.3
```

Now I'll set a breakpoint at src/biz/upload_rule.go line 109:

*[Read file: upload_rule.go (lines 100-115)]*

Now I'll set a breakpoint at line 109 in the UploadRule function:

*[Called MCP tool: set_breakpoint]*

Parameters:
```json
{
  "session_id": "session-2382038736",
  "file": "/path/to/project/admin/v1.2.3/src/biz/upload_rule.go",
  "line": 109
}
```

Result:
```
Breakpoint set at /path/to/project/admin/v1.2.3/src/biz/upload_rule.go:109 (ID: 1)
```

Now, let's run the integration test command in the background:

```bash
go run ./test/0.integration run --wait-server-ready --rpc-timeout false PrepareRule
```

Now let's continue the debugger to hit our breakpoint:

*[Called MCP tool: continue]*

Parameters:
```json
{
  "session_id": "session-2382038736"
}
```

Result:
```
Execution continued
```

Let's wait a moment for the breakpoint to be hit, then check the stacktrace:

*[Called MCP tool: stacktrace]*

Parameters:
```json
{
  "session_id": "session-2382038736"
}
```

Result:
```

I notice something concerning at line 135:
```go
if rand.Intn(100) < 512 {
    panic("invalid param")
}
```

This condition will always be true because rand.Intn(100) will return a number from 0 to 99, and it's checking if that number is less than 512 (which it always will be). This means this code will always panic. This looks like a bug in the code.
Let's continue stepping to see if this is indeed the issue:

*[Called MCP tool: next]*

*[Called MCP tool: next]*

Let's check where we are now:

*[Called MCP tool: stacktrace]*

As I suspected, the code has panicked at line 136 in the upload_rule.go file. The issue is the condition:
```go
if rand.Intn(100) < 512 {
    panic("invalid param")
}
```

Let's terminate the debug session:

*[Called MCP tool: terminate_debug]*

To fix this issue, you need to modify this condition. It seems like this might be a debugging or testing code that was accidentally left in the production code. You should either:

1.  Remove these lines completely if they're not needed

1.  Fix the condition to have a reasonable probability (e.g., rand.Intn(1000) < 1 for a 0.1% chance)

1.  Disable this check entirely by changing it to if false {

Would you like me to help you make this fix?

## Issue Identification

This condition will always be true because `rand.Intn(100)` returns a number from 0 to 99, which will always be less than 512. This causes the function to always panic with error.

## User
You've done a great job! Summarize the issue

## Assistant
I'll create a markdown file with our debugging session for you to reference later.

*[Created file: debug_case.md]*

I've created a comprehensive debug_case.md file documenting our debugging session. The file includes:

1. The issue description
2. Our debugging process and steps
3. The root cause analysis - the problematic code at lines 135-136 with the `rand.Intn(100) < 512` condition
4. Potential fix options
5. Related files and execution path of the test

This documentation should help you analyze the debugging process for future improvements. The core issue was identified as a condition that will always be true, causing the upload function to panic consistently.

Is there anything else you'd like me to include in the documentation or any other assistance you need?
