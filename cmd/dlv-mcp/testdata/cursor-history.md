I\\'ll help you debug the program and find out what\\'s behind fmt.Println at line 9 using dlv-mcp to connect to a remote debugger.

First, I\\'ll start a remote debug session by connecting to the localhost:2345 address:

Called MCP toolstart\_debug\_remote

Great! I\\'ve successfully connected to the remote debugger. Now, I\\'ll set a breakpoint at line 9 where the fmt.Println function is called:

Called MCP toolset\_breakpoint

Parameters:

{

"session\_id": "session-3862800689",

"file": "/Users/xhd2015/Projects/xhd2015/dlv-mcp/cmd/dlv-mcp/testdata/hello.go",

"line": 9

}

Result:

Breakpoint set at /Users/xhd2015/Projects/xhd2015/dlv-mcp/cmd/dlv-mcp/testdata/hello.go:9 (ID: 1)

Now I\\'ll continue the execution until we hit the breakpoint:

Called MCP toolcontinue

Parameters:

{

"session\_id": "session-3862800689"

}

Result:

Execution continued

Perfect! Let\\'s check where we are by examining the stack trace:

Called MCP toolstacktrace

Parameters:

{

"session\_id": "session-3862800689"

}

Result:

Stack trace:\\n0: /Users/xhd2015/Projects/xhd2015/dlv-mcp/cmd/dlv-mcp/testdata/hello.go:9 main.main\\n1: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/runtime/proc.go:272 runtime.main\\n2: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/runtime/asm\_arm64.s:1223 runtime.goexit\\n

Now, I\\'ll step into the fmt.Println function to see what\\'s behind it:

Called MCP toolstep\_in

Parameters:

{

"session\_id": "session-3862800689"

}

Result:

Stepped into function

Let\\'s see where we are now:

Called MCP toolstacktrace

Parameters:

{

"session\_id": "session-3862800689"

}

Result:

Stack trace:\\n0: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/fmt/print.go:313 fmt.Println\\n1: /Users/xhd2015/Projects/xhd2015/dlv-mcp/cmd/dlv-mcp/testdata/hello.go:9 main.main\\n2: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/runtime/proc.go:272 runtime.main\\n3: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/runtime/asm\_arm64.s:1223 runtime.goexit\\n

Great! We\\'ve stepped into the fmt.Println function. Let\\'s look at the code to understand how it works:

Read file

print.go:308\\x3C!---->-318

Let\\'s check the implementation of Println by looking at Fprintln, which it calls:

Read file

print.go:302\\x3C!---->-310

Let\\'s continue stepping to see more details:

Called MCP toolstep\_in

Called MCP toolstacktrace

Let\\'s step in further to see the Fprintln function in action:

Called MCP toolstep\_in

Called MCP toolstacktrace

Let\\'s look at what\\'s actually happening in the doPrintln method that gets called:

Read file

print.go:1215\\x3C!---->-1224

Let\\'s continue stepping through to see how newPrinter() is implemented:

Called MCP toolstep\_in

Called MCP toolstacktrace

Parameters:

{

"session\_id": "session-3862800689"

}

Result:

Stack trace:\\n0: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/fmt/print.go:303 fmt.Fprintln\\n1: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/fmt/print.go:314 fmt.Println\\n2: /Users/xhd2015/Projects/xhd2015/dlv-mcp/cmd/dlv-mcp/testdata/hello.go:9 main.main\\n3: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/runtime/proc.go:272 runtime.main\\n4: /Users/xhd2015/installed/go1.23.6/src/runtime/asm\_arm64.s:1223 runtime.goexit\\n

Let\\'s look at the newPrinter function:

Read file

print.go:151\\x3C!---->-160

Let me also check the pp struct definition to understand what\\'s happening:

Read file

print.go:120\\x3C!---->-150

Now I have a good understanding of what\\'s behind the fmt.Println function. Let\\'s terminate the debug session as we\\'ve learned what we need:

Called MCP toolterminate\_debug

Based on my debugging exploration, here\\'s what\\'s happening behind the scenes when fmt.Println("Hello, Debugger!") is called:

1. fmt.Println is defined in the Go standard library\\'s fmt package and takes variadic arguments of any type (...any).

1. When you call fmt.Println("Hello, Debugger!"), it internally:

* Calls Fprintln(os.Stdout, a...) which writes to the standard output

* Fprintln creates a new printer instance (pp) using a sync.Pool to optimize memory allocation

* Then calls doPrintln on that printer with your arguments

1. The doPrintln method:

* Iterates through each argument

* Adds a space between arguments (if more than one)

* Prints each argument using printArg with verb \\'v\\' (default format)

* Adds a newline character at the end

1. The printing mechanism:

* Uses a buffer to accumulate the formatted output

* Applies appropriate formatting to each argument based on its type

* Finally writes the buffer content to the specified output (os.Stdout in this case)

1. The printer instance is returned to a pool (ppFree) for reuse to avoid repeated allocations

This shows that fmt.Println in Go is an elegant wrapper around a sophisticated formatting system that efficiently handles various data types while minimizing memory allocations through object pooling.
